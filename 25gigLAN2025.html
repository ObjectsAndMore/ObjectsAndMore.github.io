      After upgrading my internet connection (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="25gigRouterBuild.html">https://objectsandmore.github.io/25gigRouterBuild.html/</a>)
      and my main workstation (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="PCBuild2025.html">https://objectsandmore.github.io/PCBuild2025.html/</a>)
      to 25 Gbit/s, it is now time to take care of the LAN infrastructure in my house. No point in having upgraded both endpoints to
      high-speed networking when I can't make use of it because of slow connections in between, right?

      <br><br>
      <h3>Existing LAN infrastructure<br></h3>

      The LAN in my house is currently only set up for 1 Gbit/s (switches, Cat 5e wiring). Perhaps the wiring would also be good for 2.5 or 5 gbit
      (or maybe even 10 gbit), given the short distances between rooms - I will do some experimenting. But I also plan on installing fiber in at
      least some of the rooms. Luckily, all rooms are fitted with in-wall conduit/tubing, which is common for houses (mine was built around 2000/01) in my area,
      with separate tubing lines for 240V power and low-voltage communications (telephone, cable TV). All conduit lines come together in a central utility room in the
      basement, which is also where power and communication lines enter the building. This room serves as my 10" rack location hosting all my IT gear (core switch,
      patch panels, Synology DiskStations, Cisco telephone gateway etc.). When I added Ethernet wiring a couple of years ago, I used the existing
      low-voltage comm tubing and added shielded Cat 5e wiring alongside the telephone wire, which was tight, but doable. Now, for adding fiber, I plan on
      adding fiber-optic cable in the tubing used for power. IMHO that should be legal and safe, as fiber-optic cable is non-conductive and should therefore not raise
      any electrical concerns. 
      
      <br><br>
      <h3>Rolling out fiber to the rooms<br></h3>

      I plan on installing fiber outlets in the rooms next to the existing outlets for power and communications. For the cleanest look, I 
      would have to go with the same vendor/brand (in my case Feller EDIZIOdue), but their fiber-compatible outlets are both extremely expensive and not very practical
      to install (flush mounted standard 70x70 mm outlet size, very tight space, no room for a fiber splice cassette). So I will go with a bigger, surface-mounted
      outlet. I will start with connecting my office room first and hope to learn some lessons as I go.

      <br><br>

      For connecting each room to the central utility room, I will use pre-assembled wall boxes that come with a 4-fiber breakout/drop cable,
      one side fitted with a pull loop (to conveniently attach a fish tape for pulling the cable through the tubing), and the other side
      fitted with 4 LC/APC connectors in LC/APC couplings (green) integrated in the wall box. Thus, only one side needs to be fitted with LC/APC connectors after
      the cable has been pulled through the tubing. There are basically two options for that:
      <br><br>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>splicing pigtails to the 4 fiber ends</li>
        <li>attaching fast connectors to the 4 fiber ends (no splicing required)</li>
      </ol> 
      My plan is to try option (b) first. If that works out, then I can get by without the additional investment in splicing equipment. If not,
      then I can always resort to option (a) later. However, a fiber-optic cleaver will be required in either case for cleanly cutting the fiber
      to prepare it for inserting it into a fast connector or for splicing.      

      <br><br>

      <h3>Fiber type and connector choices<br></h3>
      <h4>Multimode vs. Singlemode<br></h4>
      Internal (LAN) wiring is typically done with multimode fiber, whereas singlemode fiber is preferred for long-distance wiring. At least that's what I have gathered
      from various online sources. As far as I understand, singlemode fiber is more demanding, requiring tighter tolerances and therefore more expensive equipment. But 
      it looks like singlemode equipment prices have started to come down recently, so it has become much more commonplace. Also, singlemode fiber allows for bidirectional
      signals on two different wavelengths on the same fiber, reducing the number of required fibers by half. So, I decided to use singlemode/bidirectional fiber.

      <h4>Connector Types<br></h4>
      LC connectors (much smaller than SC connectors, about half the size) seem to have become a kind of standard for FTTH LAN wiring. Singlemode 
      LC connectors come in either blue or green, indicating the type of fiber polishing: APC (green) or UPC (blue). Socket and connector polishing/color 
      always have to match. Green sockets are typically used for wall outlets, while blue connecters are used on the SFP module side, so that's the standard
      I will be following.



      <br><br>
      <h3>Switches<br></h3>

      The switches will definitely have to be replaced as they are already a couple of years old and only support up to 1 Gbit/s. I have some older Netgear GS108 switches
      and some newer Zyxel GS1200-8 switches (the latter primarily because of their IP multicast support). I have not decided on the secondary switches in the 
      individual rooms (I will add these as I go), but I chose a Mikrotik CRS510-8XS-2XQ-IN as the primary "core" switch, apparently the only affordable model on 
      the market at this time with enough 25 gig ports to serve as a central switch.

      <br><br>

      The core switch will be connected directly to the router/firewall via a 1m 25 gig DAC (Mikrotik XS+DA0001). In my experience, DACs are both cheaper and
      become less hot during operation, compared to any other type of connection. This Mikrotik DAC has the additional advantage of supporting all
      SFP standards/speeds relevant to me. For the connection between router and core switch, both ends will auto-negotiate to SFP28/25 gig.
