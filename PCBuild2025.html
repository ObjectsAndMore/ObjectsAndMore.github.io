      <h1 id="mycustom25gigrouterbuild">My new PC build 2025</h1>


    I had built my current PC back in June 2011, almost 14 (!) years ago. Based
    on an Intel Core i7 2600K 3.4 GHz CPU on an Asus P8Z68-V Pro motherboard, with 
    32 GB of 668.8 MHz DDR3 memory and no seperate GPU (Intel HD Graphics 3000 CPU internal graphics
    only), it has held steady and served me well over all these years.
    <br>
    <br>
    But since I have recently bumped my internet access to 25 Gbit/s
    (see <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="25gigRouterBuild.html">https://objectsandmore.github.io/25gigRouterBuild.html/</a>)
    and started to upgrade my 1 Gbit/s LAN infrastructure to 2.5/10/25 Gbit/s, this machine seems
    to have fallen out of time. After all, it only has a PCIe Gen2 bus, and there is simply no way
    I would get a modern 10/25 Gbit/s ethernet adapter (typically PCIe Gen4 or even 5) to work in it.
    It would also not be upgradable to Windows 11 (yes, I'm actually running Windows on my PC - I'm
    content with running Linux in a VirtualBox VM &#x1F609;), so the end of Windows 10 support later
    this year was yet another reason to replace it.
    <br>
    <br>
    I had put off replacing my old PC for years. I had always been waiting for Intel to come out
    with a groundbreaking new CPU generation, reclaiming the technological lead (on x86_64) from
    AMD, so I would then be good for another couple of years with a state-of-the-art machine.
    However, year after year each new generation of Intel CPUs advanced only moderately, with no
    major technological leap in sight. Also, I am not sold on the idea of distinguishing between
    "performance" and "efficient" cores. I mean I get the point, but I have a gut feeling that this
    distinction might lead to other problems down the line, e.g. with suboptimal task scheduling
    algorithms, unexpected NUMA effects etc., so I'd rather keep my hands off of it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Now, in 2025, I finally lost patience and decided to give AMD a try. I had been pleasantly surprised
    by my experience with the AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 8700GE which I had used in my
    <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="25gigRouterBuild.html">router/firewall build</a>.
    Granted, there were more than 14 years between CPU generations, so perhaps it didn't take much
    to impress me, but seeing how easily this "lightweight" 35W TDP CPU outperforms the old i7,
    definitely left a mark. So, AMD Ryzen it is.
